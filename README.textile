h1. !http://railsapps.github.io/images/rails-36x36.jpg(Learn Rails)! Learn Rails

A Rails 4.0 example application to accompany the book "Learn Rails":http://learn-rails.com/.

The book introduces basic concepts of Rails development by showing the reader how to build an application that can be used for a typical small business website. The application includes a home page, "about" page, contact form, and option to sign up for a mailing list.

You can build this application in only a few minutes using the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool.

h2. !http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/t_logo-a.png(Follow on Twitter)!:http://www.twitter.com/rails_apps Follow on Twitter

Follow the project on Twitter: "@rails_apps":http://twitter.com/rails_apps. Please tweet some praise if you like what you've found.

h2. Tutorial

!http://railsapps.github.io/images/learn-rails-book.png(Learn Rails)!

The book is available on the website:

h4. "learn-rails.com":http://learn-rails.com/

The tutorial documents each step to follow to create the application. Every step is documented concisely, so a complete beginner can create this application without any additional knowledge.

h2. What Is Implemented -- and What Is Not

The example application is more than a learning exercise. The application can be used to build a typical simple website. It shows the simplest approach to implementing a basic website, using practices recommended by experienced Rails developers. With knowledge of Rails, the website can be adapted and customized to your needs. Features include:

* Home page
* Navigation bar
* "About" page
* Contact page with "contact request" form
* Google spreadsheet datastore
* Mailing list sign-up form

h4. Additional Pages

The application uses the "high_voltage gem":https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage for the "About" page. Additional pages can easily be added. The high_voltage gem makes it easy to add pages with static content (text that doesn't change) incorporating elements of a site-wide application layout such as header, navigation links, and footer.

For example, using the high_voltage gem, you could add pages for:

* FAQ
* News
* Legal disclaimers

h4. Mailing List Opt-In

The application home page contains a form that encourages a visitor to enter an email address to sign up for a mailing list. It can be used to collect email addresses for a newsletter or announcement mailings. The tutorial shows how to set up a MailChimp account and use the MailChimp API to add email addresses to a MailChimp list.

h4. Contact Form

The Contact page includes a "contact request" form. The contact form can be adapted for other purposes, such as an appointment request, or customized as a survey form.

When the visitor submits the form, data is saved to a spreadsheet on Google Drive that the site owner can access for review and analysis. An email message goes to the site owner containing the contents of the form.

h4. Google Spreadsheet Datastore

Google Drive (formerly known as Google Docs) provides an easy way to store and access form data using a spreadsheet. Because Google Drive manages access to the spreadsheet, authentication and authorization are not needed in the application.

h4. No Database

The application does not require a database. No pages are generated using information from a database and no user-submitted data is saved to a database. However, the sqlite3 gem must be present in the Gemfile because Rails ActiveRecord is used for form validation.

h2. Similar Examples and Tutorials

This is one in a series of Rails example apps and tutorials from the "RailsApps Project":http://railsapps.github.io/. See a list of additional "Rails examples, tutorials, and starter apps":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-examples-tutorials.html. The other examples are more complex.

h2. Accounts You Will Need

To send email from the application, and save data to a spreadsheet on Google Drive, you will need a "Gmail":https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=mail account. You can get a free "Gmail":https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=mail account if you don't already have one. Other services, such as "Mandrill":http://mandrill.com/, can be used to send email from the application. Or you can connect directly to an SMTP mail server to send email. See the article "Send Email with Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-send-email.html for more information.

The application includes a form that allows website visitors to "opt-in" to a mailing list. You'll need a "MailChimp":http://mailchimp.com/ account, which is free. MailChimp allows you to send up to 12,000 emails/month to a list of 2000 or fewer subscribers for free. There is no cost to set up an account. After you have set up a MailChimp account, create a new mailing list where you can collect email addresses of visitors who have asked to subscribe to a newsletter. The MailChimp "Lists" page has a button for "Create List." The list name and other details are up to you.

With MailChimp, you can send a welcome message automatically when the visitor signs up for the mailing list. It’s a bit difficult to find the MailChimp option to create a welcome message. Strangely, MailChimp considers a welcome message a "form." Here's how to find it. On the MailChimp "Lists" page, click the "down arrow" for a menu and click "Signup forms." Then click "Link to a form." On the "Create Forms" page, there is a dropdown list of "Forms & Response Emails." The gray box shows "Signup form." Click the down arrow. Select the menu item named "Final 'Welcome' Email" and you'll be able to create a welcome message.

We provide instructions to deploy the tutorial application to "Heroku":https://www.heroku.com/ which provides Rails application hosting. It costs nothing to set up a Heroku account and deploy as many applications as you want. To deploy an app to Heroku, you must have a Heroku account. Visit Heroku "to set up an account":https://id.heroku.com/signup/devcenter.

h2. Dependencies

Before generating your application, you will need:

* The Ruby language - version 2.0.0
* The Rails gem - version 4.0

See the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html for instructions about setting up Rails and your development environment.

h2. Getting the Application

You have several options for getting the code. You can _fork_, _clone_, or _generate_.

h3. Fork

If you'd like to add features (or bug fixes) to improve the example application, you can fork the GitHub repo and "make pull requests":http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/. Your code contributions are welcome!

h3. Clone

If you want to copy and customize the app with changes that are only useful for your own project, you can clone the GitHub repo. You'll need to search-and-replace the project name throughout the application. You probably should generate the app instead (see below). To clone:

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails.git
</pre>

You'll need "git":http://git-scm.com/ on your machine. See "Rails and Git":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-git.html.

h3. Generate

If you want to use the project as a starter application, use the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool to generate a new version of the example app. You'll be able to give it your own project name when you generate the app. Generating the application gives you additional options.

To build the example application, Rails 4.0 must be installed in your development environment. Run the command:

<pre>
$ rails new learn-rails -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>

The @$@ character indicates a shell prompt; don't include it when you run the command.

This creates a new Rails app named @learn-rails@ on your computer. You can use a different name if you wish.

You'll see a prompt:

<pre>
question  Install an example application for Rails 4.0?
      1)  Build a RailsApps starter application
      2)  Build a contributed application
      3)  I want to build my own application
</pre>

Enter "1" to select *Build a RailsApps starter application*. You'll see a prompt:

<pre>
question  Starter apps for Rails 4.0. More to come.
      1)  learn-rails
      2)  rails-bootstrap
</pre>

Choose *learn-rails*. The Rails Composer tool may give you other options (other applications may have been added since these notes were written).

The application generator template will ask you for additional preferences:

<pre>
 question  Web server for development?
       1)  WEBrick (default)
       2)  Thin
       3)  Unicorn
       4)  Puma
 question  Web server for production?
       1)  Same as development
       2)  Thin
       3)  Unicorn
       4)  Puma
 question  Template engine?
       1)  ERB
       2)  Haml
       3)  Slim
 question  Continuous testing?
       1)  None
       2)  Guard
   extras  Set a robots.txt file to ban spiders? (y/n)
   extras  Use or create a project-specific rvm gemset? (y/n)
   extras  Create a GitHub repository? (y/n)
</pre>

h4. Web Servers

We recommend Thin in development for speed and less noise in the log files.

If you plan to deploy to Heroku, select Thin as your production webserver. Unicorn is recommended by Heroku but configuration is more complex.

h4. Template Engine

The example application uses the default "ERB" Rails template engine. Optionally, you can use another template engine, such as Haml or Slim. See instructions for "Haml and Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-haml.html.

h4. Other Choices

You won't need "continuous testing" if you are a beginner. Select "none."

Set a robots.txt file to ban spiders if you want to keep your new site out of Google search results.

It is a good idea to use "RVM":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, and create a project-specific rvm gemset (not available on Windows). See "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html.

If you choose to create a GitHub repository, the generator will prompt you for a GitHub username and password.

h4. Troubleshooting

If you get an error "OpenSSL certificate verify failed" or "Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError: SSL_connect" see the article "OpenSSL errors and Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html.

If you get an error like this:

<pre>
Your bundle is complete! Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
    composer  Running 'after bundler' callbacks.
The template [...] could not be loaded.
Error: You have already activated ..., but your Gemfile requires ....
Using bundle exec may solve this.
</pre>

It's due to conflicting gem versions. See the article "Rails Error: “You have already activated (…)”":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-error-you-have-already-activated.html.

h3. Edit the README

If you're storing the app in a GitHub repository, please edit the README files to add a description of the app and your contact info. If you don't change the README, people will think I am the author of your version of the application.

h2. Getting Started

See the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html to make sure your development environment is prepared properly.

h3. Use RVM

I recommend using "rvm":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, to create a project-specific gemset for the application. If you generate the application with the Rails Composer tool, you can create a project-specific gemset.

h3. Gems

Here are the gems used by the application:

* "activerecord-tableless":https://github.com/softace/activerecord-tableless - helps to use Rails without a database
* "bootstrap-sass":https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass - Twitter Bootstrap for CSS and JavaScript
* "figaro":https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro - configuration framework
* "gibbon":https://github.com/amro/gibbon - access to the MailChimp API
* "google_drive":https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby - use Google Drive spreadsheets for data storage
* "high_voltage":https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage - for static pages like "about"
* "simple_form":http://simple-form.plataformatec.com.br/ - forms made easy

These gems make development easier:

* "better_errors":https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors - helps when things go wrong
* "quiet_assets":https://github.com/evrone/quiet_assets - suppresses distracting messages in the log

h3. Install the Required Gems

If you used the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool to generate the example app, the application template script has already run the @bundle install@ command.

If not, you should run the @bundle install@ command to install the required gems on your computer:

<pre>
$ bundle install
</pre>

You can check which gems are installed on your computer with:

<pre>
$ gem list
</pre>

Keep in mind that you have installed these gems locally. When you deploy the app to another server, the same gems (and versions) must be available.

h3. Configuration File

The application uses the "figaro gem":https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro to set environment variables in the *config/application.yml* file. The *.gitignore* file prevents the *config/application.yml* file from being saved in the git repository so your credentials are kept private. See the article "Rails Environment Variables":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-environment-variables.html for more information.

Modify the file *config/application.yml*:

<pre>
# Add account credentials and API keys here.
# See http://railsapps.github.io/rails-environment-variables.html
# This file should be listed in .gitignore to keep your settings secret!
# Each entry sets a local environment variable and overrides ENV variables in the Unix shell.
GMAIL_USERNAME: Your_Username
GMAIL_PASSWORD: Your_Password
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY: Your_MailChimp_API_Key
MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID: Your_List_ID
DOMAIN_NAME: example.com
OWNER_EMAIL: me@example.com
</pre>

For the Gmail username and password, enter the credentials you use to log in to Gmail when you check your inbox.

To add an environment variable for the MailChimp API key, "Log in to MailChimp":https://admin.mailchimp.com/ to get your API key. Click your name at the top of the navigation menu, then click "Account Settings." Click "Extras," then "API keys."

To find the MailChimp list ID, you must have already created a MailChimp mailing list. On the MailChimp "Lists" page, click the "down arrow" for a menu and click "Settings." At the bottom of the "List Settings" page, you'll find the unique ID for the mailing list.

If you already have a custom domain name you'll use when you deploy the application, you can replace @example.com@. If you deploy the application to Heroku, you'll replace @example.com@ with the unique name you've given your application on Heroku. You'll have to wait until you deploy to know the name you'll use on Heroku.

You'll send email messages to the <code>OWNER_EMAIL</code> address when a visitor submits a contact request form. Replace <code>me@example.com</code> with an email address where you receive mail.

All configuration values in the *config/application.yml* file are available anywhere in the application as environment variables. For example, @ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"]@ will return the string "Your_Username".

If you prefer, you can delete the *config/application.yml* file and set each value as an environment variable in the Unix shell.

h2. Test the App

You can check that your application runs properly by entering the command:

<pre>
$ rails server
</pre>

To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000.

You should see a home page with a placeholder photo and the "sign up" form.

!http://railsapps.github.io/images/learn-rails.png(Learn Rails)!

Enter your email address and click the "sign up" button. You should see the page redisplay with an acknowledgment message. Try entering an invalid email address such as "me@foo@", or click the submit button without entering an email address, and you should see an error message. You'll have to "log in to MailChimp":https://admin.mailchimp.com/ and check your mailing list to see if the new email address was added successfully.

You should be able to click the navigation links for "About" or "Contact" and see those pages.

Submitting the form on the "Contact" page should send an email mesage to the site owner's address and save the data to a spreadsheet on Google Drive. Visit your Google Drive account ("Drive" is in the navigation bar when you visit the Googe Search or Gmail home pages). You'll see a list of Google Drive files. The newest one will be a *Learn-Rails-Example* spreadsheet. Open the file and you will see the data from the contact form. Whenever a visitor submits the contact form, the spreadsheet will update within seconds.

Stop the server with Control-C. If you test the app by starting the web server and then leave the server running while you install new gems, you’ll have to restart the server to see any changes. The same is true for changes to configuration files in the config folder. This can be confusing to new Rails developers because you can change files in the app folders without restarting the server. Stop the server each time after testing and you will avoid this issue.

h2. Deploy to Heroku

For your convenience, here is a "Tutorial for Rails on Heroku":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-heroku-tutorial.html. Heroku provides low cost, easily configured Rails application hosting.

You'll need to precompile assets before you commit to git and push to Heroku:

<pre>
$ RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "assets compiled for Heroku"
$ git push origin master
</pre>

You'll need to set the configuration values from the *config/application.yml* file as Heroku environment variables. See the article "Rails Environment Variables":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-environment-variables.html for more information.

With the figaro gem, just run:

<pre>
rake figaro:heroku
</pre>

Alternatively, you can set Heroku environment variables directly with @heroku config:add@.

<pre>
$ heroku config:add GMAIL_USERNAME='myname@gmail.com' GMAIL_PASSWORD='secret'
$ heroku config:add MAILCHIMP_API_KEY='mykey' MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID='mylistid'
$ heroku config:add OWNER_EMAIL='me@example.com' DOMAIN_NAME='myapp.herokuapp.com'
</pre>

Complete Heroku deployment with:

<pre>
$ git push heroku master
</pre>

See the "Tutorial for Rails on Heroku":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-heroku-tutorial.html for details.
